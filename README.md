Random Flippage! Flip or Die! is your run-of-the-mill coin flip game. 

When you can't decide if you want to wear your brown or your light brown-ish shoes Random Flippage! will help you decide. 
Heck, it will decide for you. As they say, Random Flippage! Flip or Die!

Gaming Philosophy and Inspiration: As the game develops past the first stage (more elements are deployed after three wins in a row)
the game starts to reveal the overarching gaming philosophy. Inasmuch can be engineered,
games should be fun and be delightful. One element of surprise can be throttled and released
through a gaming idea I call The Speakeasy. It is one way of releasing secrets whether it be through links
or through small effects and codes or through creative storytelling. This idea will dovetail well through untapped 
pairings, ad/games that thrive on a combo that adds authenticity to brands who want to work through this method.
There is a way to tap, maximize and subvert ad revenue into real art by using the existing infrasctructure of the online world to offer customers incentives while not being obtrusive to their everyday activities.
As of now, companies are spending money and not creating love for brands. To create the Speakeasy Effect, I have identified the Nested Games idea to be best. The nest can be the secret passsage to the next game.
Now is time for a gaming revolution that will take the creative nature of storytelling coupled with the want to play fun games.
Games work well when they have a Triptych Setup. I was not able to fully employ this setup yet it stands fairly center to the overall central play philosophy.
Central Play speaks to the way that people and animals play to show that they are not a threat to one another.
Companies need to engage in this sort of play and what is better than a compelling game or mini game to entice people into this immersive world of play.
If you are able to laugh, you are willing to buy (especially in this divisive age).
Triptych View-regrettably-taps into a very ancient religious impulse to pray and worship. 
I hope that we will only use this Triptych View (which is a central-view-one-to-each-side-view) as is used in art and aviation and not for adoration.
In gaming, a central view reveals the action while the left could reveal story or communication and the right would reveal status.
In other gaming conception the Triptych View would be central vision (two eyes) with depth and individual eyes vision peripheral vision.

These are my simple planning notes used in creating the game. I found them to be helpful and fun to make.

Technologies Used: JS, HTML, CSS

Stretch Goals: Call me a yogi (with ardent understanding that I can barely touch my toes - figuratively and literally). My grand goal would to make this game endless. It would truly be a passage to an unexplored world that would be joyous to explore. The goal would be that each level would increase in a level of complexity ad infinitum. It would not need to be more complex even almost ever in appearance although at some point it must. That may take a long time as incremental levels could be put before the first and then between the second in a sort of Schrondinger's Cat of Nesting Games.
Really, as this is the first game I ever made I would like to add win and lose music. In the illustrous words of my pastor friend who made millions in the tech world: "Wouldn't it be cool if it blinked."
